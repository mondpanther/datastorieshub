To capture qualitative aspects – e.g. an individual in our dataset having a job, the gender of a person, the location of the headquarters of a company, etc. - we can use so called dummy or binary variables; i.e. we simply set variable equal to 1 if the qualitative aspect is true and to 0 if not. We will be discussing what this means for regression analysis.

After this topic, you'll hopefully think again.\r\nYou will get a brief introduction into Machine Learning. Compared to the rest of the course, Machine Learning is essentially econometrics where we are more concerned about prediction rather than the identification of causal relationships.\r\nLearning Objectives\r\nExplain the basic principles of machine learning\r\nImplement simple machine learning applications.\r\nSlides\r\n\r\nTopic8_MachineLearning_Part1.pdf\r\nTopic8_MachineLearning_Part2.pdf\r\n\r\nAdditional Material\r\n\r\nTopic8_LearningLikeaMachine.html\r\nTopic8_LearningLikeaMachine.Rmd\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nExercises 8\r\n\r\nTopic 9 - Time for Series\r\n\r\n\r\nMore...\r\n\r\nTo do any data analysis we need different datapoints. Most data we looked at so far was cross sectional data; i.e. datapoints derived from several data units (e.g. individuals, countries, cities, firms). Alternatively, we might have data for just one data unit but over many different periods of time (e.g. years, quarters, days or even sometimes seconds). This creates some specific issues, which we will discuss. Given that time itself causes a form of confounding and correlation from one datapoint to the next, we might get some very biased estimates if we are not careful.\r\nLearning Objectives\r\nIdentify the problems related to time series data\r\nCorrectly implement causal analysis in a time series context.\r\nSlides\r\n\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.pdf\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.pptx\r\n\r\nAdditional Material\r\n\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.html\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.Rmd\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nExercises 9\r\n\r\nGroup Coursework\r\nAs part of this course you are asked to hand in a piece of group coursework. For this you are asked to provide some simple a short report on anything you like as long as it involves a discussion of a dataset and some of the methods we discussed in this class. I.e. think of a good question, some data and a strategy to say something towards the answer of the question using data.\r\nYou find a template with further instructions here (RMarkdown Version).\r\nPast Exam Papers\r\n\r\n\r\nMore...\r\n\r\nPast Exam 1\r\nPast Exam 2\r\nPast Exam 3\r\n\r\nDatasets for past papers (and more)\r\n\r\n\r\nMore...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nback2country_set.dta\r\nets_thres_final.csv\r\nforeigners.csv\r\nguns.csv\r\nhals1prep.csv\r\nlfsclean.dta\r\nmaketable1.csv\r\nmaketable2.csv\r\nmaketable4.csv\r\nmigrants.csv\r\nNH.Ts+dSST.csv\r\noj.csv\r\npopulationclean.csv\r\npopulationdata.csv\r\nprod.csv\r\nprod_balanced.csv\r\nproddata_clean.csv\r\nproduction2.csv\r\nstatistic_id183497_population-in-the-states-of-the-us-2019.csv\r\nstatistic_id183497_population-in-the-states-of-the-us-2019.xlsx\r\nTableWages.csv\r\nTeachingRatings.csv\r\nUK Gender Pay Gap Data - 2017 to 2018.csv\r\nunempprep.csv\r\nunempprep.dta\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

To capture qualitative aspects – e.g. an individual in our dataset having a job, the gender of a person, the location of the headquarters of a company, etc. - we can use so called dummy or binary variables; i.e. we simply set variable equal to 1 if the qualitative aspect is true and to 0 if not. We will be discussing what this means for regression analysis. Moreover, we will be looking at some nonlinear regression models.\r\nLearning Objectives\r\nConduct regression analysis with dummy variables\r\nInterpret regression results correctly.\r\nSlides\r\n\r\nTopic6_EconometricsforDummies.pdf\r\nTopic6_EconometricsforDummies.pptx\r\n\r\nAdditional Material\r\n\r\nTopic6_EconometricsforDummies (ms-rmartin-ws2's conflicted copy 2020-12-17).html\r\nTopic6_EconometricsforDummies.html\r\nTopic6_EconometricsforDummies.Rmd\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nExercises 6\r\n\r\nTopic 7 - Instrumental Variables\r\n\r\n\r\nMore...\r\n\r\nSuppose you want to know the causal effect of a variable X on a variable Y but there are concerns that X might be endogenous because of omitted variable bias for instance.

Most data we looked at so far was cross sectional data; i.e. datapoints derived from several data units (e.g. individuals, countries, cities, firms). Alternatively, we might have data for just one data unit but over many different periods of time (e.g. years, quarters, days or even sometimes seconds). This creates some specific issues, which we will discuss. Given that time itself causes a form of confounding and correlation from one datapoint to the next, we might get some very biased estimates if we are not careful.\r\nLearning Objectives\r\nIdentify the problems related to time series data\r\nCorrectly implement causal analysis in a time series context.\r\nSlides\r\n\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.pdf\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.pptx\r\n\r\nAdditional Material\r\n\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.html\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.Rmd\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nExercises 9\r\n\r\nGroup Coursework\r\nAs part of this course you are asked to hand in a piece of group coursework. For this you are asked to provide some simple a short report on anything you like as long as it involves a discussion of a dataset and some of the methods we discussed in this class. I.e. think of a good question, some data and a strategy to say something towards the answer of the question using data.\r\nYou find a template with further instructions here (RMarkdown Version).\r\nPast graded exercise papers\r\nGraded Assignment 2019\r\nGraded Assignment 2018\r\nDatasets for past graded papers (and more)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nback2country_set.dta\r\nets_thres_final.csv\r\nforeigners.csv\r\nguns.csv\r\nhals1prep.csv\r\nlfsclean.dta\r\nmaketable1.csv\r\nmaketable2.csv\r\nmaketable4.csv\r\nmigrants.csv\r\nNH.Ts+dSST.csv\r\noj.csv\r\npopulationclean.csv\r\npopulationdata.csv\r\nprod.csv\r\nprod_balanced.csv\r\nproddata_clean.csv\r\nproduction2.csv\r\nstatistic_id183497_population-in-the-states-of-the-us-2019.csv\r\nstatistic_id183497_population-in-the-states-of-the-us-2019.xlsx\r\nTableWages.csv\r\nTeachingRatings.csv\r\nUK Gender Pay Gap Data - 2017 to 2018.csv\r\nunempprep.csv\r\nunempprep.dta\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If you are right the menu box should turn blue)\r\nQuestion 1\r\nSuppose you have estimated the following regression model on a representative sample of the UK population \\[\\log(Weight_i)=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 Female_i+\\beta_2 AGE_i +\\beta_3+AGE_i^2+\\epsilon_i\\]\r\nwhere Weight_i is weight of a person in 100s of kilograms Suppose you find that \\(\\hat\\beta_1=-0.10\\) Which of the following is a correct interpretation?\r\nThe average weight for women is 10kg\r\nWomen – on average - weigh 10 kg less than men\r\nWomen – on average – weigh 10% less than men\r\nNone of the above.\r\nCorrect answer abcd\r\n\r\nQuestion 2\r\nFor the model from Question 1: suppose you find that \\(\\hat\\beta_2=0.01\\) and \\(\\hat\\beta_3=-0.0001\\) . What does it tell you about the age at which we expect people to be heaviest?\r\nAt 25 years\r\nAt 75 years\r\nAt 40 years\r\nNone of the above\r\nCorrect answer abcd\r\n\r\n\r\nHint\r\n\r\nBecause \\(\\beta_3\\) is negative the weight-age relationship is hump shaped. We can find the maximum of the hump by setting the gradient equal to 0 implying\r\n\\[0.01-2\\times 0.0001\\times AGE=0\\] Consequently:\r\n\\[AGE=\\frac{0.01}{2\\times 0.0001}=50\\]\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 3\r\nUsing a univariate model you obtain a parameter estimate \\(\\hat\\beta=2.1\\) with a standard error of 0.1 obtained using a sample size of 1000 observations. Should you reject the hypothesis that β=1 at the 5% level?\r\nYes\r\nNo\r\nIt depends on the variance of the residuals\r\nIt depends on the variance of the explanatory variable\r\nabcd\r\n\r\n\r\nHint\r\n\r\nThe t value becomes $t==$21 , which is larger than 1.96, the 5% critical threshold with a standard normal distribution. Note that 1000 observations we can ignore that the t-statistic is only approximately normally distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 4\r\nThe demand for a new drug is known to be linear and downward sloping; i.e. a higher price means a lower demand. A researcher provided an estimate of this demand curve but suspects that a confounding factor led to a downward bias. This means that the estimated curve is\r\nFlatter than it should be\r\nSteeper than it should be\r\nUpward sloping\r\nNone of the above\r\nabcd\r\n\r\nQuestion 5\r\nThe probability that a standardised normal variable takes a value of zero or more is:\r\nEqual to zero.\r\n50%\r\n95% for a significance level of 0.1\r\nI need more information on the variance and probability distribution to answer this question.\r\nabcd\r\nQuestion 6\r\nThe R output below shows a regression of COVID19 cases per student among US Universities in Fall 2020.
