Emphasis will be on\r\npractical data skills as well as the ability to formulate a question\r\nappropriately, provide data analysis relevant to the question and\r\ninterpret the results correctly. As part of the course you will be asked\r\nto provide a small piece of data analysis.\r\nClass participation...\r\nTo get your participation mark please participate in the Datathon\r\nForum with either questions or answers or by sharing relevant stuff\r\n(e.g. an interesting dataset or article). You find the forum here.\r\nYou should already be enrolled to participate. But if not let me know.\r\nPlease only participate with your official Imperial Email address.\r\nTopic 1 - Introduction\r\n\r\n\r\nMore...\r\n\r\nLearning Objectives\r\nUnderstanding what causal relationships are\r\nBecome aware of factors that lead to biased estimates of causal\r\nrelationships\r\nUnderstand upward and downward bias\r\nUnderstand the concept of endogenous and exogenous variation.\r\nDiscuss causal identification and biases in the context of a\r\nunivariate linear model\r\nSlides\r\n\r\nIntroductionESB.pdf\r\nIntroductionESB.pptx\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nExercises\r\n1\r\nFurther reading\r\nIntroduction\r\nto Econometrics with R, Chapters 1-3\r\nCausal\r\nData Science in Large U.S. Firms\r\n\r\nTopic 2- Rrrr\r\n\r\n\r\nMore...\r\n\r\nWe take a first look at the R software package and programming\r\nlanguage, which we will be using throughout this module.

After this topic, you'll hopefully think\r\nagain.\r\nYou will get a brief introduction into Machine Learning. Compared to\r\nthe rest of the course, Machine Learning is essentially econometrics\r\nwhere we are more concerned about prediction rather than the\r\nidentification of causal relationships.\r\nLearning Objectives\r\nExplain the basic principles of machine learning\r\nImplement simple machine learning applications.\r\nSlides\r\n\r\nTopic8_MachineLearning_Part1.pdf\r\nTopic8_MachineLearning_Part2.pdf\r\n\r\nAdditional Material\r\nMachine Learning\r\nCompetition\r\n\r\nTopic8_LearningLikeaMachine.html\r\nTopic8_LearningLikeaMachine.Rmd\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTopic 9 - Time for Series\r\n\r\n\r\nMore...\r\n\r\nTo do any data analysis we need different datapoints. Most data we\r\nlooked at so far was cross sectional data; i.e. datapoints derived from\r\nseveral data units (e.g. individuals, countries, cities, firms).\r\nAlternatively, we might have data for just one data unit but over many\r\ndifferent periods of time (e.g. years, quarters, days or even sometimes\r\nseconds). This creates some specific issues, which we will discuss.\r\nGiven that time itself causes a form of confounding and correlation from\r\none datapoint to the next, we might get some very biased estimates if we\r\nare not careful.\r\nLearning Objectives\r\nIdentify the problems related to time series data\r\nCorrectly implement causal analysis in a time series context.\r\nSlides\r\n\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.pdf\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.pptx\r\n\r\nAdditional Material\r\n\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.html\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.Rmd\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nExercises\r\n9\r\nFurther Reading\r\nIntroduction\r\nto Econometrics with R, Chapter 14 &15\r\n\r\nCourse Summary Slides\r\nHere\r\nAlternative download location\r\n\r\nsummary2021.pptx\r\n\r\nGroup Coursework\r\nAs part of this course you are asked to hand in a piece of group\r\ncoursework. For this you are asked to provide some simple a short report\r\non anything you like as long as it involves a discussion of a dataset\r\nand some of the methods we discussed in this class. I.e. think of a good\r\nquestion, some data and a strategy to say something towards the answer\r\nof the question using data.\r\nYou find a template with further instructions here\r\n(RMarkdown\r\nVersion).\r\nPast Exam Papers\r\n\r\n\r\nMore...\r\n\r\nPast\r\nExam 1\r\nPast\r\nExam 2\r\nPast\r\nExam 3\r\nPast\r\nExam 4\r\nTo prepare also look at Exercises\r\n10\r\n\r\nDatasets for past papers (and\r\nmore)\r\n\r\n\r\nMore...\r\n\r\n\r\n- [ back2country_set.dta ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/back2country_set.dta ) \r\n- [ driving.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/driving.csv ) \r\n- [ ets_thres_final.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/ets_thres_final.csv ) \r\n- [ foreigners.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/foreigners.csv ) \r\n- [ guns.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/guns.csv ) \r\n- [ hals1prep.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/hals1prep.csv ) \r\n- [ house.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/house.csv ) \r\n- [ lfsclean.dta ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/lfsclean.dta ) \r\n- [ maketable1.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/maketable1.csv ) \r\n- [ maketable2.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/maketable2.csv ) \r\n- [ maketable4.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/maketable4.csv ) \r\n- [ migrants.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/migrants.csv ) \r\n- [ NH.Ts+dSST.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/NH.Ts+dSST.csv ) \r\n- [ oj.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/oj.csv ) \r\n- [ populationclean.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/populationclean.csv ) \r\n- [ populationdata.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/populationdata.csv ) \r\n- [ prod.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/prod.csv ) \r\n- [ prod_balanced.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/prod_balanced.csv ) \r\n- [ proddata_clean.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/proddata_clean.csv ) \r\n- [ production2.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/production2.csv ) \r\n- [ statistic_id183497_population-in-the-states-of-the-us-2019.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/statistic_id183497_population-in-the-states-of-the-us-2019.csv ) \r\n- [ statistic_id183497_population-in-the-states-of-the-us-2019.xlsx ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/statistic_id183497_population-in-the-states-of-the-us-2019.xlsx ) \r\n- [ TableWages.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/TableWages.csv ) \r\n- [ TeachingRatings.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/TeachingRatings.csv ) \r\n- [ UK Gender Pay Gap Data - 2017 to 2018.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/UK Gender Pay Gap Data - 2017 to 2018.csv ) \r\n- [ unempprep.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/unempprep.csv ) \r\n- [ unempprep.dta ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/unempprep.dta ) \r\n- [ us-states.csv ]( https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/data/us-states.csv ) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For those who\r\nhave not yet been programming this will be a steep learning curve.\r\nHowever, it should be worth it.\r\nYou will not be able to analyse data effectively without being\r\nfamiliar with basic programming concepts. What’s more, to grasp many\r\naspects of today’s world an understanding of programming is key. Even if\r\nyou don’t envisage a career as master coder or data analyst, trying\r\nthese things for yourself will be useful as you will very likely have to\r\nmanage coders and analysts or rely on their work at some point in your\r\ncareer.\r\nLearning Objectives\r\nInstall R and RStudio on your computer.\r\nUse R as a glorified pocket calculator\r\nLoad a dataset and provide simple analysis of it.\r\nHave an understanding of programming concepts such as loops\r\nBe able to merge or join different data sources using code.\r\nLearn how to create data yourself using random number\r\ngenerators.\r\nSlides\r\n\r\nTopic2_Rrrrr.pdf\r\nTopic2_Rrrrr.pptx\r\n\r\nAdditional Material\r\n\r\nFarageGarage.html\r\nFarageGarage.Rmd\r\nTopic2_mostofR4u.docx\r\nTopic2_mostofR4u.html\r\nTopic2_mostofR4u.Rmd\r\ncovidNvax_simple.html\r\ncovidNvax_simple.nb.html\r\ncovidNvax_simple.Rmd\r\n\r\nVideo Guide: R scripts\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo Guide: Installing R Packages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo Guide: Functions in R\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nExercises\r\n2\r\nFurther Reading\r\nR\r\nfor Data Science\r\nThe definite\r\nguide to R Markdown\r\n\r\nTopic 3 - Visions\r\n\r\n\r\nMore...\r\n\r\nSome of the best ways to understand data are graphs and\r\nvisualisations.

What does it tell\r\nyou about the age at which we expect people to be heaviest?\r\nAt 25 years\r\nAt 75 years\r\nAt 40 years\r\nNone of the above\r\nCorrect answer\r\nabcd\r\n\r\n\r\nHint\r\n\r\nBecause \\(\\beta_3\\) is negative the\r\nweight-age relationship is hump shaped. We can find the maximum of the\r\nhump by setting the gradient equal to 0 implying\r\n\\[0.01-2\\times 0.0001\\times AGE=0\\]\r\nConsequently:\r\n\\[AGE=\\frac{0.01}{2\\times\r\n0.0001}=50\\]\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 3\r\nUsing a univariate model you obtain a parameter estimate \\(\\hat\\beta=2.1\\) with a standard error of\r\n0.1 obtained using a sample size of 1000 observations. Should you reject\r\nthe hypothesis that β=1 at the 5% level?\r\nYes\r\nNo\r\nIt depends on the variance of the residuals\r\nIt depends on the variance of the explanatory variable\r\nabcd\r\n\r\n\r\nHint\r\n\r\nThe t value becomes $t==$21 , which is larger than 1.96, the 5%\r\ncritical threshold with a standard normal distribution. Note that 1000\r\nobservations we can ignore that the t-statistic is only approximately\r\nnormally distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 4\r\nThe demand for a new drug is known to be linear and downward sloping;\r\ni.e. a higher price means a lower demand. A researcher provided an\r\nestimate of this demand curve but suspects that a confounding factor led\r\nto a downward bias. This means that the estimated curve is\r\nFlatter than it should be\r\nSteeper than it should be\r\nUpward sloping\r\nNone of the above\r\nabcd\r\n\r\nQuestion 5\r\nThe probability that a standardised normal variable takes a value of\r\nzero or more is:\r\nEqual to zero.\r\n50%\r\n95% for a significance level of 0.1\r\nI need more information on the variance and probability distribution\r\nto answer this question.\r\nabcd\r\nQuestion 6\r\nThe R output below shows a regression of COVID19 cases per student\r\namong US Universities in Fall 2020.

In particular, you will\r\ndevelop an understanding of how to formulate research purposes and\r\nquestions to study healthcare organizations, how to choose the research\r\nsetting through purposeful sampling, and how to collect and analyse\r\ninterview data. You will also familiarize with some of the most relevant\r\nmethodologies (e.g., grounded theory, ethnography, etc.)\r\nPart II - Quantitative methods\r\nIn this part we give you an introduction into common concepts and\r\ntools for data analysis in economics and business. Emphasis will be on\r\npractical data skills as well as the ability to formulate a question\r\nappropriately, provide data analysis relevant to the question and\r\ninterpret the results correctly.

You will then\r\nexplore examples of relevant research questions in healthcare settings\r\nand try your hand at developing your own. You will learn the criteria\r\nfor choosing an ideal research setting.\r\nQualitative Methods 2\r\nIn this session, you will learn how to develop interview protocols\r\nand to identify the main issues in collecting interview data for\r\ninductive research. You will also gain familiarity with the main\r\ntechnique for analysing textual data and with the validity criteria of\r\ninductive theory. Finally, you will get introduced to the main\r\nmethodologies for conducting inductive research.\r\nPart II - Quantitative\r\nMethods\r\nWeek 2\r\nTopic 1 - Introduction\r\n\r\n\r\nMore...\r\n\r\nLearning Objectives\r\nUnderstanding what causal relationships are\r\nBecome aware of factors that lead to biased estimates of causal\r\nrelationships\r\nUnderstand upward and downward bias\r\nUnderstand the concept of endogenous and exogenous variation.\r\nDiscuss causal identification and biases in the context of a\r\nunivariate linear model\r\nSlides\r\n\r\nIntroductionSRM.pdf\r\nIntroductionSRM.pptx\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nExercises\r\n1\r\nFurther reading\r\nIntroduction\r\nto Econometrics with R, Chapters 1-3\r\nCausal\r\nData Science in Large U.S. Firms\r\n\r\nTopic 2 - Rrrr\r\n\r\n\r\nMore...\r\n\r\nWe take a first look at the R software package and programming\r\nlanguage, which we will be using throughout this module.

To capture qualitative\r\naspects – e.g. an individual in our dataset having a job, the gender of\r\na person, the location of the headquarters of a company, etc. - we can\r\nuse so called dummy or binary variables; i.e. we simply set variable\r\nequal to 1 if the qualitative aspect is true and to 0 if not.

Most data we\r\nlooked at so far was cross sectional data; i.e. datapoints derived from\r\nseveral data units (e.g. individuals, countries, cities, firms).\r\nAlternatively, we might have data for just one data unit but over many\r\ndifferent periods of time (e.g. years, quarters, days or even sometimes\r\nseconds). This creates some specific issues, which we will discuss.\r\nGiven that time itself causes a form of confounding and correlation from\r\none datapoint to the next, we might get some very biased estimates if we\r\nare not careful.\r\nLearning Objectives\r\nIdentify the problems related to time series data\r\nCorrectly implement causal analysis in a time series context.\r\nSlides\r\n\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.pdf\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.pptx\r\n\r\nAdditional Material\r\n\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.html\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.Rmd\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nExercises\r\n9\r\nFurther Reading\r\nIntroduction\r\nto Econometrics with R, Chapter 14 &15\r\n\r\nGroup Coursework\r\nAs part of this course you are asked to hand in a piece of group\r\ncoursework.

To capture qualitative\r\naspects – e.g. an individual in our dataset having a job, the gender of\r\na person, the location of the headquarters of a company, etc. - we can\r\nuse so called dummy or binary variables; i.e. we simply set variable\r\nequal to 1 if the qualitative aspect is true and to 0 if not. We will be\r\ndiscussing what this means for regression analysis. Moreover, we will be\r\nlooking at some nonlinear regression models.\r\nLearning Objectives\r\nConduct regression analysis with dummy variables\r\nInterpret regression results correctly.\r\nSlides\r\n\r\nTopic6_EconometricsforDummies.pdf\r\nTopic6_EconometricsforDummies.pptx\r\n\r\nAdditional Material\r\n\r\nTopic6_EconometricsforDummies.html\r\nTopic6_EconometricsforDummies.Rmd\r\nTutorial3_2021.html\r\nTutorial3_2021.Rmd\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nExercises\r\n6\r\nFurther Reading\r\nUsing R\r\nfor Introductory Econometrics Chapter 7\r\nIntroduction\r\nto Econometrics Chapters 5.3 and 6.9\r\n\r\nTopic 7 - Instrumental\r\nVariables\r\n\r\n\r\nMore...\r\n\r\nSuppose you want to know the causal effect of a variable X on a\r\nvariable Y but there are concerns that X might be endogenous because of\r\nomitted variable bias for instance.

Most data we\r\nlooked at so far was cross sectional data; i.e. datapoints derived from\r\nseveral data units (e.g. individuals, countries, cities, firms).\r\nAlternatively, we might have data for just one data unit but over many\r\ndifferent periods of time (e.g. years, quarters, days or even sometimes\r\nseconds). This creates some specific issues, which we will discuss.\r\nGiven that time itself causes a form of confounding and correlation from\r\none datapoint to the next, we might get some very biased estimates if we\r\nare not careful.\r\nLearning Objectives\r\nIdentify the problems related to time series data\r\nCorrectly implement causal analysis in a time series context.\r\nSlides\r\n\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.pdf\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.pptx\r\n\r\nAdditional Material\r\n\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.html\r\nTopic9_TimeSeries.Rmd\r\n\r\nExercises\r\nExercises\r\n9\r\nFurther Reading\r\nIntroduction\r\nto Econometrics with R, Chapter 14 &15\r\n\r\nGroup Coursework\r\nAs part of this course you are asked to hand in a piece of group\r\ncoursework.
