In the lecture we discussed the notion of causality. We contrasted the a certain causality mechanism (your story) with the causality mechanism(s) that might be driving your data (the data story). For good dataanalysis you need to be aware of both: Have a clear idea of what you want to analyse or explore as well as of all the things that could be going on in your data. To practice this I ask you to go through a couple of examples. These are typically strong correlations that have been found in a dataset or another.
