Your task this week is to get some data from somewhere and create a figure or visualisation in R along with a discussion of what we might be seeing. The R Markdown for lecture 3 provides you with some starting points. You find the Rmd code [here](https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/code/Topic3_Visions.Rmd) and the compiled html output [here](https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/code/Topic3_Visions.html)
