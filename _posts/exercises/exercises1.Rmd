Dale and Lisa are developing an R package called [`webex`](https://github.com/dalejbarr/webex) to make it easier to make web-based exercises. It provides an RMarkdown template and a few functions to make questions that automatically give feedback and hint or solution buttons.

Create fill-in-the-blank questions using `fitb("4")`, providing the answer as the first argument.

- 2 + 2 is `r fitb("4")`

Distill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.
