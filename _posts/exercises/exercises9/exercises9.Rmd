# Exercise 9.1

The [`oj.csv`](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o76do0oyoxhhy6p/oj.csv?dl=1) dataset contains monthly data
on the log price of (frozen) orange juice concentrate (for the US) as the variable `lnp`. A large part of the orange production in the US originates from Florida. Hence, the weather in Florida is potentially an important factor in the orange price.
Frost is rare in Florida. But when it happens it is particularly detrimental for the orange harvest. 
The `fdd` contains the number of freezing degree days in a month.



```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
oj=read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/o76do0oyoxhhy6p/oj.csv?dl=1")

```

```{r}
##########
  oj = na.omit(oj)
  oj["lnp"]=log(oj$ppioj/oj$pwfsa *100)
  
  library(lubridate)
  oj=oj %>% mutate(date=as_date(paste0(as.character(year),"-",as.character(month),"-01")))
  
##########################  

write.csv(oj,"../../../../data/oj.csv")    
  
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
#ggplot(oj,aes(x=date,y=lnp))+geom_line(color="green")+theme_minimal()+xlab("Monthly data")
#ggplot(oj,aes(x=date,y=lnp))+geom_line()+theme_minimal()+xlab("Monthly data")  
```  


(a) Run a regression of the (log) orange juice price on freezing degree days in the previous month and interpret the regression.


`r hide("Answer:")`

To create a lagged version of the `fdd` variable we can use the `dplyr::lag()` function:

```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
oj=oj %>% mutate(L1fdd=dplyr::lag(fdd))
```

Now run a regression of the price on freezing degree days: 

```{r,echo=TRUE}
lm(lnp~L1fdd,oj) %>% summary()

```

This suggest that freezing degree days have a positive impact on the price (as we would expect: freezing means there are less oranges around so the price goes up). One day more of freezing would imply an increase
in the price by 0.2%. However, this result is not significant.


`r unhide()`


(b) Can you suggest reasons why the result in (a) might not be an unbiased estimate of the effect of 
freezing on orange juice prices?


`r hide("Answer:")`
Freezing is likely to be exogenous. So we don't have to worry about the usual confounding factors.
However, we are dealing with time series. One issue could be that the price series has a unit root. Plotting the series is 
a good start to examine this:

```{r,echo=TRUE}
p=ggplot(oj,aes(x=date,y=lnp))+geom_line(color="green")+theme_minimal()+xlab("Monthly data")

plot(p)
```


`r unhide()`

(c) Can you check if the price series has a unit root?

`r hide("Answer:")`
We can use the Dickey-Fuller test:

```{r,echo=TRUE}  

library(urca)
summary(ur.df(oj$lnp))
  
```
The test statistic is larger than the even the 10pct cut-off. Hence we cannot reject the 
hypothesis that there is a unit root.


`r unhide()`


(d) Can you suggest an alternative (unbiased) approach to estimating the effect of freezing on price?

`r hide("Answer:")`

We need to difference the series to get rid of the unit root. Note that for the differenced series we clearly
reject the unit root:


```{r,echo=TRUE}

ur.df(diff(oj$lnp)) %>% summary()

```
```{r,echo=TRUE}
oj=oj %>% mutate(Dlnp=lnp-dplyr::lag(lnp))
lm( Dlnp~L1fdd,oj) %>% summary()

```

We now find a smaller effect than before: 1 extra freezing day leads to 0.149% higher orange juice prices (i.e. we previously had an upward bias). However, the result is now significant.
