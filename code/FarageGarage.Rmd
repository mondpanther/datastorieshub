What's the link between foreigners and crime?


## Illustration 

To illustrate your story you can include images (even of [thugs who attack foreigners](https://www.freemovement.org.uk/theresa-mays-immigration-legacy/))

You can also embedd tweets. To illustrate that, let's hear some introductory remarks from Nigel Farage (The patron saint of the [Farage Garage](https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/faragegarage-trends-on-twitters-over-secret-brexit-lorry-park-1-6743902)):

# OK some more serious work now

Now let's load some data. To do that you can include chunks of are code like this:


```{r}

ff=read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/g1w75gkw7g91zef/foreigners.csv?dl=1")  

```


This loads the local authority dataset we have seen before. Note that you can include inline are code as well. 
For instance: the dataset has `r nrow(ff)` observations and contains `r ncol(ff)` variables.

As before we can summarise the data:

```{r}
summary(ff)

```


Note, you might want to see the output of a command in your final document, but you might not want to see the command. Just do it like this:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(ff)

```




```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)  # This is an extension of R that allows a more covenient handling of dataframes

ff= ff %>% mutate(crimesPc=crimes11/pop11)


```




```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)  # This is an extension of R that allows a more covenient handling of dataframes

ggplot(ff, aes(y=crimesPc,x=b_migr11)) + geom_point() 


```


Let's get rid of outliers...
...and do some other stuff to make it look nicer..

```{r drop outlier, echo=FALSE}

ff= ff %>% filter(crimesPc<15)


ggplot(ff, aes(y=crimesPc,x=b_migr11)) + geom_point()   +   # Make sure + is on this line so R understands the command is not finished
                   xlab("Share of foreign born in %")   +  
                   ylab("Number of Crimes per capita")  + 
                   theme_minimal()


```
