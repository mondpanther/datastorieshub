What's the link between foreigners and crime?


## Illustration 

To illustrate your story you can include images and hyperlinks (even of  [bullies](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-56125796) who [attack foreigners](https://www.freedomfromtorture.org/news/refugee-rights-are-under-attack-heres-everything-you-need-to-know)

You can also embedd tweets. To illustrate that, let's hear some remarks from Nigel Farage (The patron saint of the [Farage Garage](https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/faragegarage-trends-on-twitters-over-secret-brexit-lorry-park-1-6743902)):

# OK some more serious work now

Now let's load some data. To do that you can include chunks of are code like this:


```{r}

ff=read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/g1w75gkw7g91zef/foreigners.csv?dl=1")  

```


This loads the local authority dataset we have seen before. Note that you can include inline are code as well. 
For instance: the dataset has `r nrow(ff)` observations and contains `r ncol(ff)` variables.

As before we can summarise the data:

```{r}
summary(ff)

```


Note, you might want to see the output of a command in your final document, but you might not want to see the command. Just do it like this:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(ff)

```




```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)  # This is an extension of R that allows a more convenient handling of dataframes
ff= ff %>% mutate( crimesPc= crimes11/pop11)

```




```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)  # This is an extension of R that allows a more covenient handling of dataframes

ggplot(ff, aes(y=crimesPc,x=b_migr11)) + geom_point() 


```


Let's get rid of outliers...


```{r drop outlier, echo=TRUE,message=FALSE}

#ff= filter(ff,crimesPc<15)

ff= ff %>% filter(crimesPc<15)
```


...and do some other stuff to make it look nicer..


```{r}
ggplot(ff, aes(y=crimesPc,x=b_migr11)) + geom_point()   +   # Make sure + is on this line so R understands the command is not finished
                   xlab("Share of foreign born in %")   +  
                   ylab("Number of Crimes per capita")  + 
                   geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
                   theme_minimal()


```




# Running regressions:

- We said that putting in a trend line in a scatter plot is a way of estimating an 
econometric model that describes the relationship between the dependent (or outcome) variable on the Y axis and an explanatory variable on the x axis.

- If you want a computer to do this for you (rather take out a ruler and a pen) you need a precise algorithm.
- The most commonly used algorithm for that is called Ordinary Least Squares estimator (OLS).


```{r}

r1=lm(crimesPc~b_migr11,ff)  
# Note we can assign the output of a regression to a variable...

summary(r1)
# ...and then refer back to this variable in subsequent commands.
# You can check how the output of the lm command looks like by clicking on r1 in the 
# variable browser.


```

Note this identifies a linear model of the form
$$ Y_i=\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times X_i +\epsilon_i$$
where $Y_i$ is *Crimes per capita* and $X_i$ is the share of foreigners in %. This also shows you how you can integrate formulas in a markdown document and how easily format text to make it italic. More on this under [this](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-8.html) link.
<br>
Now this of course is the true model. What we get out of the OLS procedure is an estimate of the above model; i.e.
$$ Y_i=\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \times X_i +\hat{\epsilon}_i$$
which given the above R results becomes
```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}

beta0=round(r1$coefficients[[1]],3)
beta1=round(r1$coefficients[[2]],3)

```

$$ Y_i=`r beta0` + `r beta1` \times X_i +\hat{\epsilon}_i$$

where we round the results up to 3 digit precision. Check out the code for this in the underlying [Rmd file](https://mondpanther.github.io/datastorieshub/code/FarageGarage.Rmd)  as it also shows how you can refer back to a previously caclulated result within an inline formula; i.e. rather than manually typing the value for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ I let R work it out from the `lm` command.

## Implication of OLS

An important implication of the OLS estimator is that it works out the $\beta$ parameters in a way that sets correlation between $\hat{\epsilon}$ and $X$ equal to 0. To check that this is the case we extract the $\epsilon$ from the `r1` variable and add it to our `ff` dataframe.

```{r}

ff['residuals']=r1$residuals  
#Note this is an alternative way of assigning a new variable to a dataframe.
#Alternatively use:
ff=ff %>% mutate(residualsx1=r1$residuals)

```

Note that the correlation is indeed 0:
```{r}

  ff %>% select(residuals,b_migr11, pop11)  %>% cor(use="complete.obs")

  10^17
```

Which we can also see in a scatterplot:
```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
  ggplot(ff, aes(x = b_migr11, y = residuals)) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    geom_point()+theme_minimal()+
    xlab("% foreign born")+ylab("Regression residuals")

```



# Merging data

A big part of applied data analysis involves combining different bit of data. For that you need `merge` or `join` commands. Here is an example where we add more area level variables to our foreigners dataset:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
ff_raw=read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/g1w75gkw7g91zef/foreigners.csv?dl=1")  




ff_more=read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/gwq2wmmxr8s3v7t/foreigners_more.csv?dl=1")  

names(ff_more)

inner=ff_raw %>% inner_join(ff_more,by="area")
inner=ff_raw %>% full_join(ff_more,by="area")

inner=ff %>% inner_join(ff_more,by="area")
full=ff %>% full_join(ff_more,by="area")



```

Dataframe `ff` has `r nrow(ff)` observations. Dataframe `ff_more` has `r nrow(ff_more)`.
The inner join has `r nrow(inner)`, the full join `r nrow(full)`.

# Doing stuff by region and how to use functions

One of the variables we merged earlier includes a region variable. The following command counts the number of observations for every region.
```{r}
inner %>% group_by(region) %>% summarise(n())
```

### Define the function:

```{r}

plotter=function(r){
  
  ffx=inner %>% filter(region==r)
  
  plot=ggplot(ffx, aes(x = b_migr11, y = crimesPc)) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    geom_point()+theme_minimal()+
    xlab("% foreign born")+ylab("Crimes per capita")+
    ggtitle(r)
  
  
  reg=(lm(crimesPc~b_migr11,ffx))
  return(list(plot,reg))
}
```

### Call the function:
```{r calling the function,message=FALSE}
p=plotter("London") 
p[[1]];summary(p[[2]])

p=plotter("East")
p[[1]];summary(p[[2]])

p=plotter("South West")
p[[1]];summary(p[[2]])


```


### Or maybe doing it with a loop?
```{r,message=FALSE}
regions=inner$region %>% unique()



for(rrr in regions){

  p=plotter(rrr)
  print(p[[1]])
  print(summary(p[[2]]))

}
```



```
