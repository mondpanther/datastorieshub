# Introduction

Following President Trump's deceleration of a national emergency in response to the Covid-19 pandemic in early March 2020, many US states initiated stay-at-home orders later that month. The resulting 265 million Americans urged to stay home lead to a transformation in education with many universities and colleges transitioning to online teaching for the remainder of the Spring Term (NYT, 2020). With a decline in cases during the summer months, many universities decided to re-open for the Fall Term, both through in-person teaching and a re-opening of on-campus housing in August 2020. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that during June-August incidence was highest in the age group 20-29 years, over 20% of all confirmed cases, with many attributing the rise to the re-opening of universities (CDC, 2020). In this study, we want to investigate what causes some universities to see greater Covid-19 cases than others. Given the novel nature of the pandemic, we want to investigate three variables that have been linked to infections: the usage of masks, the occurrence of 'superspreader' events such as parties, and lastly a measure of "intelligence" for understanding health and safety guidelines put in place. We predict that all three variables will have an impact on Covid-19 infections at institutions of higher education. In order to investigate this further, we want to fit the model: 
$$ Y_i = \beta_1 InvalidMaskUse_i + \beta_2 AcademicRank_i + \beta_3 PartyRank_i + \beta_4 X_i + \epsilon_i$$
Where $Y_i$ is the outcome variable of Covid-19 infections at respective institutions, $InvalidMaskUse$ is the percentage of people in the institutions county wearing masks "unreasonably", $AcademicRank$ is the Academic Rank of the institution and $PartyRank$ a measure of the institutions partying reputation. Finally, $X_i$ are various sets of control variables. 

# Methods and Data

As illustrated in the model, the variables investigated as the drivers of infections were: mask usage at a county level, an institutions' academic ranking, an lastly the institutions rank of "partyness". We will use the enrollment of full-time students and the percentage of out-of-state students as control variables.  

We obtained data on Covid-19 cases by institution from the NYT repository that is updated weekly for over 1,900 institutions. In addition, we obtained the academic ranking of the institution from Forbes America's Top Colleges in 2019 and the number of students from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). The IPEDS database also provided data on the portion of first-time undergraduates who are out-of-state students for each institution. However as the IPEDS database listed universities by individual campuses and the Forbes ranking and NYT repository the institution as a whole, we had to drop the sample of institutions with multiple campuses in order to join the data sets. The dropping of some institutions likely had an impact on our regression as a institution such as Arizona State University with various campuses (Downtown Phoenix, Polytechnic, Skysong, Tempe and West) was dropped despite having one of the highest Covid-19 cases currently (2,826 cases). 

For the additional independent variable "mask", we used a mask data set from the NYT, which breaks down the people's willingness of wearing a mask in each county into five categories: always, frequently, sometimes, rarely and never. Given that only wearing a mask can reasonably prevent the spread of Covid-19, we use the rate of people wearing masks improperly (i.e. sometimes, rarely and never) to measure citizen's sense of preventing Covid-19 in each county. Given the data set provides the data corresponding to each FPIDS, and each county contains many FPIDs, we grouped the data set by county and then calculated the average percentage of those FIPS in each county as the percentage of people in each county who wear a mask "unreasonably". A higher number indicates a lower awareness of safety in the given county (i.e. less mask usage). We merged the processed data set with the previously created data set based on the county in which the institution is located. 

Finally, because the spread of Covid-19 is assumed to be greatest at large and unsafe gatherings - so called superspreader events such as at parties - we decide to include a party variable of a institution. Given there was no data set available for this, we found a list of the Top Party Schools from Niche.com, which is based on student feedback, and performed a webscrape to create our own data set of institution name and party rank, where a low rank indicates the institution deemed to be the greatest party school and the highest rank the least party school. 

With these variables in mind we first ran simple linear regressions of the individual variables (invalid mask use, academic rank and party rank) on institution cases and later a multi-linear regression with all variables, as well as with the control variables of total students and percentage of out-of-state students. Finally, we included a interaction of students and masks.

# Results

### Covid-19 Infections and Masks

Looking at Covid-19 infections at institutions on the inefficient usage of masks in the institutions county shows the following: 

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
#drop the outlier and get the graph
ggplot(datafinal1%>%filter(datafinal1$case<2500),aes(x=invalidmask,y=case))+
  geom_point()+ylab("Covid-19 Infections at Insitution")+xlab("Invalid utilization of masks in county")+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  ggtitle("Covid-19 Infections vs The share of invalid utilization of masks")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.45, vjust=2.12))
```

Looking at the plot we observe the cluster of infections below 250, with a range of unreasonable mask utilization ranging from 0% to 38%. Due to the scattered nature of the data, the results may have been affected.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#simple regression of case on invalidmask
modcm<-lm(case~invalidmask,datafinal2)
summary(modcm)
```

We find that a 1% increase in the unreasonable utilization of masks in the institutions county leads to 6.58 increase in Covid-19 infections at the respective university. However, the coefficient is not significant. Given that many institutions implement and enforce their own hygiene and safety standards, the mask usage in the county might not be representative of the sample of students. In addition, though some students might wear masks, their families may not and infection may thus occur at home rather than on campus itself.    

### Covid-19 Infections and Academic Rank

It could be assumed that more intelligent students, solely based on academic ranking, are more likely to follow Covid-19 regulations as they understand the CDC guidelines to a great extent and its implications for the spread of the virus.

``` {r,echo = FALSE}
#drop the outlier and get the graph
ggplot(datafinal1%>%filter(datafinal1$case<2500),aes(x=rank,y=case))+
  geom_point()+ylab("Covid-19 Infections at Insitution")+xlab("Academic Rank of Institution")+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  ggtitle("Covid-19 Infections vs Academic Rank of Institution")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.45, vjust=2.12))
```


Looking at Covid-19 infections at institutions on the academic ranking of the institutions county shows the following: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#simple regression of case on rank
modcr<-lm(case~rank,datafinal1)
summary(modcr)
```

We observe that as a college rank increases (i.e. is considered less respected in the ranking) the number of Covid-19 infection decreases, contrary to the hypothesis stated. Though this coefficient is not significant, one can see a relationship between lower Covid-19 infections at less "elite" universities. Of course rankings are not the sole indicator of students intelligence and often include assessments of academic publications, facilities and other support functions. However, a reason for this relationship may be that lower-ranked institutions place less pressure on students to be present on campus and thus a higher absence from class (and more digital learning) leads to less infection. Vica-versa, higher-ranking schools may place a greater emphasis on group assignments where face-to-face discussions are necessary, leading to increase in cases. In addition, a students desire to be present at a school might be linked to it's rank - a first-year undergraduate student at Harvard, might be willing to risk more in terms of infections to experience the campus than a student admitted to a lower ranking institution.   

### Covid-19 Infections and Party Rank

Given that 'superspreader' events are one of the main drivers of infections we plotted the infections of institutions with the corresponding party rank. We observe a clear relationship between schools that have a greater party reputation and a greater number of Covid-19 infections. It could be, that students at institutions known to have more parties are still holding such events despite the pandemic.  

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#drop the outlier and get the graph
ggplot(dataparty%>%filter(dataparty$cases<2500),aes(x=partyrank,y=cases))+
  geom_point()+ylab("Covid-19 Infections at Insitution")+xlab("Party Rank of Institution")+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  ggtitle("Covid-19 Infections vs Party Rank of Institution")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.45, vjust=2.12))
```


Looking at the regression we see: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#simple regression of case on partyrank
modcr<-lm(dataparty$cases~dataparty$partyrank)
summary(modcr)
```

A increase in the rank of party, meaning an institution being less regarded as a party school, leads to a decrease in Covid-19 infections. We find a statistically significant relationship between schools that are known as "Top Party School" and more Covid-19 infections. As the rank of a institution increases by 10, the number of confirmed cases will decrease by 13.34. Parties can be considered 'superspreader' events, where many people are likely to interact in close proximity of each other. In addition, one can assume that there is alcohol involved and consequently less conscious effort placed on social distancing. Mask wearing at such an event is highly unlikely. However, a problem with the interpretation could be that bigger institutions are also more likely to be regarded as party schools. As a consequence, running a regression of Covid-19 infections on the number of enrolled students (Appendix 1.1) shows a statistically significant correlation as well, where large institutions, on average, have more Covid-19 infections. This confounding factor will be considered further in the study.    

### Multi-linear regression

To ensure that all variables can be considered in the model at the same time, we run a correlation analysis. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#original model
cor(datafinal2[,-c(2,4,5,6,7)])
```
As the three variables are not correlated, issues of multi-collinearity can be ignored and we can include all variables in a regression. 

Running a multi-linear regression of all variables we find: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#original model
mod1<-lm(case~invalidmask+rank+partyrank,datafinal2)
summary(mod1)
```

The invalid usage of masks becomes somewhat significant, supporting the hypothesis that a greater misuse of masks leads to more infections. The academic rank of the institution remains insignificant with the coefficient decreasing, meaning there is even less of an impact of "intelligence" measured through a ranking on infections. Finally, the party reputation of an institution remains significant but becomes -1.83 instead of -1.35, thus suggesting a greater decrease in cases as a institutions becomes less known for its parties. 

This model could suffer from various confounding factors:

* Party rank and cases: Because the number of students at each institution is positively related to cases (Appendix 1.1), we might conclude that more students also have more social contact and thus greater risk of infection. Meanwhile, the number of students is negatively related to Party Rank of the institution, meaning that a institution with more students tends to have more of a partying reputation. Therefore the coefficient of Partyrank has a downward bias. 

* Student and cases: A institution's attractiveness to out-of-state students can be quantified by share of currently enrolled out-of-state students. This could be related to the total number of students, as a institutions attractiveness to out-of-state students might lead to more applications and more admittance. However, the share of out-of-state students can also be positively related to the number of Covid-19 infections. These students might need to travel more across thus having a higher risk of infection. This will lead to an upward bias. At the same time, with institutions switching to multi-model teaching, many foreign students may choose to study remotely resulting in less potential risk of contracting the virus. Thus, it's also possible to have a downward bias in this scenario.

* Rank and cases: The share of out-of-state could be negatively related to academic rankings. Institutions with more international students may show greater cultural diversity and ability to attract international talent, leading to a higher rank (but a smaller value). However, as mentioned the proportion of out-of-state students can be positively or negatively related to cases making the bias on the coefficient of rank difficult to interpret.  

To visualize the need for control variables, consider the model below: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#control variable
library(png)
library(RCurl)
control <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zihanz14/data_team17/main/Logic%20graph.png"
img <- readPNG(getURLContent(control))
plot.new() 
rasterImage(img,0,0,1,1)
```

In order to better deal with the above discussed confounding factors, the control variables of out-of-state students and student population are included in the adjusted model.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#adjusted model with control variable
mod2<-lm(case~invalidmask+rank+partyrank+outstaterate+student,datafinal2)
summary(mod2)
```
Looking at the regression, we see that all coefficient have virtually become 0, though all somewhat statistically significant. The interpretation of such regressions is highly subjective as the impact is so limited. Some factors to consider: 

* Out-of-state and cases: There is a slight negative correlation between out-of-state students and infections. As predicted previously, it could be that many institutions transitioned to online teaching and encouraged students to remain home and study online. Given that the coefficient is not significant, it could be that due to the previously mentioned issues there is no clear trend in the data.

* Out-of-state and academic ranking: Adding out-of-state students as a control variable led to the rank coefficient becoming significant and decreasing substantially from -0.086 to -0.746.  

* Out-of-state and party rank: Adding the control variables decreased the effect of the confounding factors discussed previously. Though the coefficient remains significant, the impact has decreased substantially. However, we still find that institutions with a party reputation see more Covid-19 infections.

Finally, we look at our model with the controls and an interaction between students and mask use. The addition of the interaction term could be used to understanding if the utilization of masks can offset the negative effect of the increase in number of students. A unit influence of the number of students would reduce as the improper use of masks decreases.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#adjusted model with control variable and interaction term
mod3<-lm(case~student*invalidmask+rank+partyrank+outstaterate,datafinal2)
summary(mod3)
#conduct a F-test to see the joint effect of mask and mask*student
linearHypothesis(mod3,c("invalidmask=0", "student:invalidmask=0"), vcov = vcovHC, type = "HC1")
```

Upon adding the interaction term of students and masks, the mask variable alone becomes insignificant. This could be because there is co-llinearity between invalidmasks and students:invalidmask variable. But in the F-test, invalidmasks and students:invalidmask jointly perform a significant effect on the dependent variable -- the p-value is 7.546e-05. Even though the coefficients individually are not significant what matters is that they jointly do

The coefficient of student decreases from 0.0322 to 0.0149. This could be because the regression divides student's effect on cases into two parts: student and student:mask. Since the coefficient of student:mask is 0.1055 we can expect cases to increase more for a given change in students when improper mask usage is greater. In other words, if the college is in a county where people are taking less preventative measures (such wearing a mask), the increase in the number of students at an institution will generate more Covid-19 infections. For example, let's take an institution which is located in a county with a 10% unreasonable mask usage. If the number of students increases by 100, there will be 2.549 more cases, whereas for a institution in a county with 80% unreasonable mask usage the same increase in students will lead to a 9.934 increase in Covid-19 infections.  

# Conclusion

We decided to analyze how Covid-19 infections at colleges and universities may be affected by numerous variables. We found that the clearest contributor to the number of infections was the party reputation. However, when controlling for various factors, mask usage and academic rank also become significant though with the coefficients becoming virtually zero, the impact of the chosen model is questionable. 

Our model is limited in various ways. Firstly, we ignored time series data. Only using Covid-19 infections at a certain point in time cannot accurately reflect the trend of Covid-19 at institutions. Given that many institutions as a result of the significant spike in cases recently have decided to close campuses or significantly limit in-person teaching, the model now might not be as informative as it would have been at the onset of the Fall Term in August/September. Our data set could also have been improved further by including international student data, instead of the proxy of out-of-state students used in the regressions. 

Additionally, it would be important to include a measure of the public health infrastructure institutions have set up as this may be a strong factor in preventing Covid-19 infections. Many institutions have set up health messaging platforms as well as testing schemes that have been successful in curbing the spread of infections on campuses. Given that such data is currently not available for a large sample, this was not possible. Other variables such as how porous a county is, could have also provided further insights on the spread of Covid-19 in more isolated versus community integrated campuses.
